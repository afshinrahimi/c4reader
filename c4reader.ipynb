            "941 I also included some random bits that I thought my mom would like, like the Kopari Coconut Oil Pullers, this is a very Niche Mothers Day gift but available if your mom is into it.

            "942 Sunnee at Fragrance Obsessed likens it to Bed, Bath, and Beyond's store scent and it does very much remind me of that too. It is a sweet fruity floral that almost smells like Lush's Snow Fairy mixed in with Rosegirl's Gilligan's Brew.\n",
            "943 We try our yabao several times a year and keep a journal of tasting notes to see how it is growing. Age yabao just like you would another loose sheng pu’er – keep it away from light and excess moisture, and store it away from strong smells and distinctive odors (like basements, spice cabinets and bathrooms).\n",

It smells like shampoo and absorbs easily.\n",
            "956 If you don’t feel like rowing, Ripple Effect Ecotours also offers tours on its Ripple Effect 1, a boat powered by recycled vegetable oil collected from the frying pans of local restaurants. In case you’re curious, yes, the boat’s exhaust smells exactly like fries!\n",

            "968 The Great Pumpkin Massacre is clearly a perfect Halloween mixture with a fabulous scent to boot. The scented version smells just like pumpkin bread, it even has a hint of cinnamon that makes me want to chew on my nails.\n",
            "969 The worst part is that these abandoned storefronts, these out-of-business businesses, are so quickly and easily replaced. Rather than being able to relish in a town that once-was, a town that could-have-been, leafing through its relics and vestiges like a living scrap book, I must confront a new sign, a new menu, a new owner, a new clientele, new smells, new flavors, new seats at the bar, in a new place that will soon become some other New York girl's favorite.\n",

            "973 This is a really complex, unique and delectable scent. I’m not generally a fan or honey or honey scents but with Hot Maple Toddy, it smells more like maple syrup, which I love, with citrus notes from the lemon element, a dash of spices and I’m pretty sure I can detect some booziness in it, which is always good!\n",

For someone who was born on the Mediterranean, like me, the pine smell is one of the finest smells ever.\n",
            "985 I must start by saying that personally I do not agree much with the definitions I read online about this scent: I wouldn’t define this an “ozonic” scent, although I admit one of the key notes here is a sort of aqueous-mineral feel, but rather “organic”, lacustrine and almost moldy (sort of sweetish-salty). What I smell more though is a loud, pungent herbal-peppery smell in which angelica surely plays the dominant role, with its peculiar leafy smell sweetish and bitter at the same time, on a base in which I get quite a remarkable dose of ambergris; and oddly enough, it smells like real ambergris to me.\n",
            "986  It tastes like hot chocolate mix smells!\n",
            "987 We stand spellbound at the supermarket isle, a specialty shop, pulling out our cell phones to call our relatives and beloved, uttering the names full of mystery and enigma: Époisses de Bourgogne, Brie de Meaux , Tomme de Savoie, Queijo do Pico, Leerdammer.

            "993 It’s a distant memory in the world of industrial food, where fruit is picked green and stored for months, even years, in cool rooms and then sprayed with ripening agents before being stacked on shelves where it never actually softens at all because it’s a shadow of its real self.

            "995 I certainly don’t. But perhaps because I’ve been feeling like so much time is spent focused on work these days, I’ve been hankering for a way of life that only seems to exist in reruns; one where friends linger idly, the air smells of French Roast, and cake in the middle of the day is a guilt-free affair.\n",

            "999 You are able to feel the smell of cayenne peppers and even that alone can give your nose a little spicy tickle, but the thing is that the rodents nose and sense of smell are a lot stronger than yours, so if you think the smell is bad, think of how much it will affect them. So add Cayenne peppers to smells rodents don't like.\n",

With saxophonists Kenny Blake and Joe Graziosi on separate tracks (except on a track called “Think About It” where they appear together); guitarist Ken Karsh, bassists Wilbur Krebs and Fred Ervin on separate tracks, and Pete Tokar and Brett Williams on Rhodes and piano on separate tracks, this smells and sounds like success to this writer for sure.\n",
            "1173 It comes in both 13\" and 15\" sizes, puts the book back into Macbook. Made like an actual hardbound book cover, this case is constructed with uber-durable buckram linen cloth and smells just like a good book.\n",
            "1174 I am not a huge baker (think refrigerated cookie dough), but I do like making banana bread to give out as holiday treats and I do like to make the occassional cookies. More than anything I just like the feeling I get when the house is warm and smells good.\n",
            "1175 While it’s important to create headlines that pique the interest of potential readers and consumers, it’s much more important to create headlines that are truly reflective of the content they will find in your article.

            "1176 I’ve had an obsession with scented geraniums ever since I was seven years old and first visited the Botanical Center (now Botanical Gardens) in Des Moines. There is something magical about rubbing a leaf and having a scent appear that smells like a fruit or flower.\n",
            "1177 When it is unearthed the white is a dark brown clear jelly and the yolk is dark green or black and slimy. It smells like sulphur or rotten eggs and tastes like a hardboiled egg until you breathe out.\n",
            "1178 I use their purple shampoo incredibly regularly, as it cuts through brassiness in my hair, and leaves it super soft and shiny, so, when I saw that PRO:VOKE had released these dinky little shots, I couldn’t wait to give them a shot! After shampooing as normal (btw the Touch of Silver shampoo smells incredible – like grape candy) I unwrapped one of the vials and got to work.\n",
            "1179 It was deeply strange, to close your eyes, and to not see any less well than you had before. It made Mouse feel suddenly very small, and very alone, like a tiny, infinitesimal spark, floating alone through the infinite blackness of space, without even the starlight to guide her, or the city sounds and smells to beckon her home.\n",

            "1184 Maybe that's the question we should be asking ourselves first. I mean Ralph also says things like \"My cat's breath smells like cat food.\"\n",
            "1185 If you suffer from allergic reactions, you will want to get a quality hypo-allergenic microfiber down comforter where the down has actually been washed to remove it of naturally taking place dust and dirt particles that will trouble somebody with allergies.

            "1192 I usually approach reviews for this kind of classic compositions trying to avoid the usual note explanation. I generally prefer to give an overall idea of what the fragrance smells like and always suggest to any \"real\" perfume lover to not miss the chance to experience such classic beauties.\n",
            "1193 It's about time to start burning them again, and for today I've picked a candle from Betty Crocker that I've gotten from a local supermarket.

            "1197 In a Randolph County North Carolina school, law enforcement in schools and rising racial animus seem to have come together violently in late September.

            "1202 It is also the thing I have had the least luck finding a tasty substitute for…until recently that is. My husband had been doing some research and found out that there are some companies making ‘real’ vegan cheese using live cultures and nuts to give it a flavour and texture more like normal dairy cheese and less like the stuff you get in the supermarket that is grey, looks like rubber and smells like arse.\n",
            "1203 Strawberries would make my list of top five fruits (with golden kiwi, apples, bananas and rockmelon) and after weeks of only getting 3 or 4 a day from the garden I found 20 ripe ones yesterday.

            "1208 He taught me how to recognize sassafras, and we would dig up the roots and take them back to his house to boil for tea. It smells amazing - like rich, aromatic root beer.\n",
            "1209 I did go ahead and try it on my hair and made sure to use a lot as a test and am happy to say it did not leave any kind of residue on my hair. And it smells really good too – a little fruity smell to it, but not like sickeningly sweet or anything.\n",

            "1211 Leaving it there allows it to rot (consuming pond oxygen in the process) and make a mess of the pond.

            "1214 Delicious Delights Cool Swirl was launched in 2015. This is a really nice and subtle perfume, it smells like pistachio ice cream with a bowl of almonds on the side, a very light gourmand and would be good to wear in the springtime!\n",
            "1215 During menstruation period, this drink can be a very enjoyable. The smells of the drinks can hold you back from drinking it, its smell like bitter turmeric (which logic of course), but ignore that.\n",
            "1216 The smell of sea salt pressed against my nostrils and kept me going closer. It wanted me to keep it with me, somehow, to carry it with me so every time I opened the door to my apartment, I would smell the same smells, feel the air, and feel like I lived in paradise.\n",
            "1217 Whenever. i throw stuff like meat & milk out when it smells, & meds i keep till they're gone.\n",
            "1218 But we likely let our minds wander. It might be what to do for lunch, that the person smells like garlic, or we pretend merely to listen until there is a pause and we can start to talk about what we want to say in words and gestures.\n",

            "1221 On stony patches we can also observe herbs like oregano or Thyme (Thymus sp.). This one actually smells like lemon, so it could be T. pulegioides.\n",
            "1222 An explanation and an exhortation to “smell it!” have not often been met with equal enthusiasm. Sourdough starter smells like the soul of bread—a cool, yeasty aroma that can make a centuries-old Parisian bakery of even the most meager outer-borough galley kitchen—but what is it, exactly?\n"
